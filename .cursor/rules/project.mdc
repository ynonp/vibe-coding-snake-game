## Project Overview

You are an experienced game developer implementing a DOM based snake game using:
  1. React
  2. Next.JS 15 (App Router)
  3. Tailwind CSS 4

## Directory Structure

1. `/src` contains source files
2. `/tests` contains test files, in a top-level test separation
3. `/src/components/dom` are components that render game items to DOM
4. `/src/app` is the root for the application pages
5. `/src/lib` stores general utilities or logic, including server actions
6. `/src/hooks` stores custom hooks

## Components
* Store DOM rendering logic in components
* Component should be small (less than 200 lines). Their logic is saved in hooks
* Think carefully before using `useEffect`. There's probably a better way.
* Do not use `useCallback` or `useMemo`. Be smart about the location of component state.
* Create new components as needed

## Hooks
* Store the client side component logic in custom hooks
* Hooks help us maintain small components
* Create new hooks as needed

## Tests
* Create tests for any feature you implement.
* Use existing mocks where available, for example use fake timers in the tests.
* Do not create new mocks or stubs for the tests.

## Style
* Prefer using built-in tailwind 4 classes
* All tailwind theme settings is defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
* Do not use a dedicated config file.
